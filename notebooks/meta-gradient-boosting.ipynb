    "- Download 15-minute OHLCV data for META from Yahoo Finance\n",
    "- Engineer a rich set of technical features (RSI, EMA, ATR, Bollinger Bands, MACD, rolling stats, lags, simple regime feature)\n",
    "- Define a forward-looking label that captures \"good trades\" based on a take-profit (TP) and stop-loss (SL) within a fixed horizon\n",
    "- Train a Gradient Boosting classifier with time-series cross-validation\n",
    "- Inspect feature importances and model quality\n",
    "- Convert model probabilities into a very naive trading strategy and look at the resulting equity curve\n",

    "- Respecting temporal order (no leakage)\n",
    "- Translating model outputs into something decision-oriented (in this case, a simple trading rule)"
